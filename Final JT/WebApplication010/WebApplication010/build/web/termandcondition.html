The display or printed output that is generated by the User at the time of operation of Internet Banking Services is a record of the operation of the Internet access and shall not be construed as the Bank’s record of the relative transactions. The Bank’s own records of transactions maintained through computer systems or otherwise shall be accepted as conclusive and binding for all purposes. All transactions arising from the use of Internet Banking Services to operate a joint account, shall be binding on all the joint account holders , jointly and severally, notwithstanding that one amongst such joint account holders only operates the accounts through Internet Banking Services.</p>
